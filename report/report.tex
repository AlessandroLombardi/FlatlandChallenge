\section{Flatland}

The analyzed version is the 2.1.10

\subsection{The classes RailAgentStatus and EnvAgent}

RailAgentStatus extends Python IntEnum and assumes the following values:
\begin{itemize}
	\item READY\_TO\_DEPART (0) the agent is not in the grid yet (position is None), the prediction is to stay at the starting position. If a MOVE\_* action is performed during this state it becomes ACTIVE\@.
	\item ACTIVE (1) the agent is in the grid (position is not None) and hasn't reached the target yet, the prediction is the remaining path.
	\item DONE (2) the agent is still in the grid (position is not None) but has already reached the target, the prediction is to stay at the target forever.
	\item DONE\_REMOVED (3) the agent has reached the target and it's removed from the grid.
\end{itemize}

Grid4TransitionsEnum extends Python IntEnum and assumes the following values: NORTH (0), EAST (1), SOUTH (2), WEST (3).
Grid4TransitionsEnum is used to indicate absolute directions, related to the environment, like a compass.
Possible usages are storing where the agent is facing or computing legal actions, for example including as observation a one hot encoding of the directions where the agent can move.
\\
EnvAgent class models the agent and encapsulates in its internal state the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item initial\_position: Tuple[int, int], initial coordinate.
	\item initial\_direction: Grid4TransitionsEnum, the initial agent facing direction.
	\item direction: Grid4TransitionsEnum, the current facing direction.
	\item target: Tuple[int, int], the final coordinate.
	\item moving: bool, True if the agent is in a moving state.
	\item speed\_data: dictionary, TODO
	\item malfunction\_data: dictionary, TODO
	\item status: RailAgentStatus, the current agent status.
\end{itemize}

The speed of an agent contains the keys 'position\_fraction' used as a counter of the percentage of completion of an movement from a cell to another, 'speed' the value between 0 and 1 used to increment the 'position\_fraction' and 'transition\_action\_on\_cellexit' which contains the action to perform on the next cell (if it completes the one in the current step).

The malfunction of an agent contains the keys 'malfunction' which contains how many steps are necessary to fix the agent, 'malfunction\_rate', the mean rate (average number of events in an interval) of the Poisson distribution, 'next\_malfunction' the number of steps the next malfunction will occur and 'nr\_malfunctions' the number of previous malfunctions.

\subsection{The class RailEnv}

From the documentation
\begin{quotation}
	RailEnv is an environment inspired by a (simplified version of) a rail
    network, in which agents (trains) have to navigate to their target
    locations in the shortest time possible, while at the same time cooperating
    to avoid bottlenecks.
\end{quotation}

In the \textit{step} function the number of steps is updated and if the overall task is still uncompleted, for each agent the associated reward is initially put to zero, a malfunction is tried to be induced and the specific step is performed.
The info of the agent are prepared and finally the end malfunctions are repaired.
Agents are handled in the order in which are passed.

\subsubsection*{Environment Actions}
The avaiable actions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item DO\_NOTHING (0) Default action if None has been provided or the value is not within this list. If agent.moving is True then the agent will MOVE\_FORWARD\@.
    \item MOVE\_LEFT (1) If agent.moving is False then becomes True. If it's possible turn the agent left, changing its direction, otherwise if agent.moving is True tries the action MOVE\_FORWARD\@.
    \item MOVE\_FORWARD (2) If agent.moving is False then becomes True. It updates the direction of the agent and if the new cell is a dead-end the new direction is the opposite of the current.
    \item MOVE\_RIGHT (3) If agent.moving is False then becomes True. If it's possible turn the agent right, changing its direction, otherwise if agent.moving is True tries the action MOVE\_FORWARD\@.
    \item STOP\_MOVING (4) If agent.moving is True then becomes False. A penalty will be added. Stop the agent in the current occupied cell.
\end{itemize}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\uIf{agent is in DONE or in DONE\_REMOVED ($1^{\text{th}}$ case)}{
		no reward is computed\\
		\Return{}
	}
	\uIf{agent is in READY\_TO\_DEPART ($2^{\text{th}}$ case)}{
		if the provided action is a MOVE\_* type and the initial cell is free the agent become ACTIVE and is initialized\\
		reward is computed\\
		\Return{}
	}
	\uIf{agent is in malfunction (($3^{\text{th}}$ case))}{
		reward is computed\\
		\Return{}
	}
	\uIf{agent is at the beginning of a cell}{
		update agent.moving considering the observations above depending on the different action types.\\
		\uIf{agent.moving}{
			the wanted action validity is first checked and if it is valid (considering also the possibility to backup from an invalid MOVE\_RIGHT or MOVE\_LEFT to a valid MOVE\_FORWARD) action is stored otherwise agent.moving becomes False and penalties are added, in this process agent.moving and agent.speed\_data['transition\_action\_on\_cellexit'] are updated
		}
	}

	\eIf{agent.moving ($4^{\text{th}}$ case)}{
		Updates the percentage of completion then if it is completely arrived on the next cell, before updating the position, the direction and clears the completion percentage it checks whether the new cell is free. Until the cell remains occupied in the future executions the agent will repeat this process.\\

Some useful questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An agent can stop during an action between two cells? Absolutely no, it's like any other action.
	\item Requested actions during a malfunction are ignored? Yes.
	\item Requested actions during a not completed movement are saved for after execution? No, because the condition at line 11 is not executed and the conditions in line 16 check whether the cell is free and possibly complete agent data. Actions are not allowed to change within the cell, each agent can only chose an action to be taken when entering a cell. This action is then executed when a step to the next cell is valid.
	\item How is possible to understand if an agent is ready to perform an action? The entry info_dict["action_required"] returned by the function \textit{step} of \textbf{RailEnv} contains True for the given agent. This doesn't mean that the action will be successfully executed due to the presence of malfunctions or blocking agents, in this case info_dict["action_required"] will remain True.
	\item When an agent reaches DONE is removed automatically the following step? TODO Yes.
	\item Does an agent automatically pass from READY\_TO\_DEPART to ACTIVE at the beginning? TODO No. A MOVE\_* is necessary.
	\item Do collisions occur? No, agents check if the cell is free before moving. Deadlocks are possible when two agents are one in front the other without any chance to change path.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Malfunctions}
The strategy depends on the passed \textit{malfunction\_generator\_and\_process\_data}.
TODO

\begin{itemize}
	\item A malfunction can occur during the resolution of another? TODO
	\item An agent could have a malfunction during the completion of an action between two cells? TODO Yes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Speed}
The different speed profiles (speed is between 0 and 1) can be generated using the schedule\_generator.
Speed configurations can be build using \textbf{ScheduleGenerator}s.
TODO

\subsubsection*{Rewards}
The rewards are based on the following values:
\begin{itemize}
	\item invalid\_action\_penalty which is currently set to 0, penalty for requesting an invalid action
	\item \textbf{step\_penalty} which is -1 * alpha, penalty for a time step.
	\item \textbf{global\_reward} which is 1 * beta, a sort of default penalty.
	\item stop\_penalty which is currently set to 0, penalty for stopping a moving agent
	\item start\_penalty which is currently set to 0, penalty for starting a stopped agent
\end{itemize}

The full step penalty is computed as the product between step\_penalty and agent.speed\_data['speed'].
There are different rewards for different situations:

\begin{itemize}
	\item single agents that are in DONE or in DONE\_REMOVED have zero reward ($1^{\text{th}}$ \textit{\_step\_agent} case).
	\item all agents that have finished in this episode (checked at the end of the \textit{step}) or previously (checked at the beginning of the \textit{step}), have reward equal to the global\_reward (when in \textit{step} all agents have reached their target)
	\item full step penalty is assigned when an agent is READY\_TO\_DEPART and in the current turn moves or stay there ($2^{\text{th}}$ \textit{\_step\_agent} case), or when is in malfunction ($3^{\text{th}}$ \textit{\_step\_agent} case).
	\item full step penalty plus the other penalties (invalid\_action\_penalty, stop\_penalty and start\_penalty) when the agent is finishing actions or start new ones ($4^{\text{th}}$ \textit{\_step\_agent} case). Currently the other penalties are all set to zero.
\end{itemize}

So each train starts counting rewards since the beginning, not since it becomes ACTIVE\@.
Currently it is possible to say that rewards are always full step excluding the end of the episode and the single agents that have finished which have reward equal to 0.
